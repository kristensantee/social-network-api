## Overview
This project is to construct a new social media API utilizing the Mongoose package with Mongodb. The API features users, thoughts (posts), reactions to those thoughts, and a friends list.

## Description
This API stores all users, their friends in the social media app, their posted thoughts, and their friends' reactions to those thoughts. Users can post, put, and delete their thoughts, as well as adding or deleting friends from their friend list. Routes also include the opportunity to view all thoughts and users as well as targeting individual users and individual thoughts with component attributes and virtuals for more usable data.
